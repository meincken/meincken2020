When I started meincken.com it was mainly as a portfolio for my work, over the years it has gone through a few changes, upgrades, but for along time it went unloved and ignored. In 2014 I created my company which in turn required an online presence (which I’m working on) so it was not worth repeating my work.

Now we come to 2015, I have a lot of hobbies, so figured it would be a good place to dump my thoughts, passions and photography. So expect some of my work in this field over the past 20 years along with my bike races, triathlons, running, climbing and many other activities to pop up.

Also in my plan is to cover my main passion, and for those who don’t know… This is cycling. I have a sub domain called bikes and bits, but figured I may just merge it into this one.
